[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pycudadecon/badge/?version=latest)](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-green.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This package provides a python wrapper and convenience functions for [cudaDeconv](https://github.com/dmilkie/cudaDecon), which is a CUDA/C++ implementation of an accelerated Richardson Lucy Deconvolution algorithm<sup>1</sup>, suitable for general applications, but designed particularly for stage-scanning light sheet applications such as Lattice Light Sheet.  cudaDeconv was originally written by [Lin Shao](https://github.com/linshaova) and modified by [Dan Milkie](https://github.com/dmilkie), at Janelia Research campus.  This package makes use of a cross-platform shared library interface that I wrote for cudaDecon while developing [LLSpy](https://github.com/tlambert03/LLSpy) (a Lattice light-sheet post-processing utility), that adds a couple additional kernels for affine transformations and camera corrections.  The code here is mostly extracted from that package and cleaned up to allow it to be used independently of LLSpy.

The main features are:
* radially averaged OTF generation
* OTF interpolation for voxel size independence between PSF and data volumes
* CUDA accelerated deconvolution with a handful of artifact-reducing features.
* Deskew, Rotation, and general affine transformations
* CUDA-based camera-correction for [sCMOS artifact correction](https://llspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/camera.html)
* a few context managers for setup/breakdown of GPU-I/O-heavy tasks and convenience functions
* windows, linux
* mac supported only on OS X ≤ 10.3, with an NVIDIA card.  open an issue if you need support.

### Why do we need yet another python package for deconvolution?
Honestly, we probably don't.  But since cudaDecon was recently open-sourced, and I had mostly already written this wrapper, it seemed appropriate to release it.  I do think the C++ backbone is well done, and it's relatively mature and tested at this point.  That said, there are some other good python deconvolution packages out there such as [flowdec](https://github.com/hammerlab/flowdec), and probably many others.

### gputools
Similarly, if you've stumbled upon this looking for GPU-accelerated affine transformations, then feel free to try these out, but don't miss the fantastic [gputools](https://github.com/maweigert/gputools) package, which provides OpenCL-acceleration for a number of image processing algorithms including affine transforms (and much more).

## Installation
Precompiled libraries are available for windows, linux, and mac via conda.
Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), add a couple channels to your config, then install pycudadecon:

```bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda config --add channels talley

# in some cases, installing into the base environment has prevented pycudadecon from
# functioning properly... best to install into a clean environment along with
# whatever other dependencies you want (e.g. ipython, jupyter, etc)
$ conda create -n decon_env pycudadecon

# then activate that environment each time before using
$ conda activate decon_env
```

### GPU requirements

This software requires a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU.
The underlying libraries (llspylibs) have been compiled against different versions of the CUDA toolkit.  The required CUDA libraries are bundled in the conda distributions so you don't need to install the CUDA toolkit separately.  If desired, you can pick which version of CUDA you'd like based on your needs, but please note that different versions of the CUDA toolkit have different GPU driver requirements (the OS X build has only been compiled for CUDA 9.0).  To see which version you have installed currently, use `conda list llspylibs`, and to manually select a specific version of llspylibs:

| CUDA  | Linux driver | Win driver | Install With |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------   | -----------  |
| 10.0  | ≥ 410.48     | ≥ 411.31   | `conda install llspylibs=<version>=cu10.0`  |
|  9.0  | ≥ 384.81     | ≥ 385.54   | `conda install llspylibs=<version>=cu9.0`  |

...where `<version>` is the version of llspylibs you'd like to install (use `conda search llspylibs` to see available versions)

If you run into trouble, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/tlambert03/pycudadecon/issues) and describe your setup.

## Usage

If you have a PSF and an image volume and you just want to get started, check out the [`pycudadecon.decon()`](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deconvolution.html#pycudadecon.decon) function, which is designed be able to handle most basic applications.

```python
from pycudadecon import decon
image_path = '/path/to/some_image.tif'
psf_path = '/path/to/psf_3D.tif'
result = decon(image_path, psf_path)
```

For finer-tuned control, you may wish to make an OTF file from your PSF using [`pycudadecon.make_otf()`](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/otf.html?highlight=make_otf#pycudadecon.make_otf), and then use the [`pycudadecon.RLContext`](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deconvolution.html?highlight=RLContext#pycudadecon.RLContext) context manager to setup the GPU for use with the [`pycudadecon.rl_decon()`](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deconvolution.html?highlight=RLContext#pycudadecon.rl_decon) function.  (Note all images processed in the same context must have the same input shape).

```python
from pycudadecon import RLContext, rl_decon
from glob import glob
import tifffile
image_folder = '/path/to/some_images/'
imlist = glob(image_folder + '*488*.tif')
otf_path = '/path/to/pregenerated_otf.tif'
with tifffile.TiffFile(imlist[0]) as tf:
    imshape = tf.series[0].shape
with RLContext(imshape, otf_path, dz) as ctx:
    for impath in imlist:
        image = tifffile.imread(impath)
        result = rl_decon(image, ctx.out_shape)
        # do something with result...
```

If you have a 3D PSF volume, the [`pycudadecon.TemporaryOTF`](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/otf.html?highlight=temporaryotf#pycudadecon.TemporaryOTF) context manager facilitates temporary OTF generation...

```python
 # continuing with the variables from the previous example...
 psf_path = "/path/to/psf_3D.tif"
 with TemporaryOTF(psf) as otf:
     with RLContext(imshape, otf.path, dz) as ctx:
         for impath in imlist:
             image = tifffile.imread(impath)
             result = rl_decon(image, ctx.out_shape)
             # do something with result...
```

... and that bit of code is essentially what the [`pycudadecon.decon()`](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deconvolution.html#pycudadecon.decon) function is doing, with a little bit of additional conveniences added in.

*Each of these functions has many options and accepts multiple keyword arguments. See the [documentation](https://pycudadecon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for further information on the respective functions.*
