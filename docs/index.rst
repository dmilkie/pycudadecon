pyCUDAdecon
===========

pyCUDAdecon is a python wrapper and set of convenience functions for `cudaDeconv <https://github.com/dmilkie/cudaDecon>`_ (which is a CUDA/C++ implementation of an accelerated Richardson Lucy Deconvolution [#f1]_).  cudaDeconv was originally written by `Lin Shao <https://github.com/linshaova>`_ and modified by `Dan Milkie <https://github.com/dmilkie>`_, at Janelia Research campus.  This package makes use of a shared library interface that I wrote for cudaDecon while developing `LLSpy <https://github.com/tlambert03/LLSpy>`_, that adds a couple additional kernels for affine transformations and camera corrections.

Quickstart
----------

If you have a PSF and an image volume and you just want to get started, check out the :func:`pycudadecon.decon` function, which should be able to handle most basic applications.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pycudadecon import decon
    >>> image_path = '/path/to/some_image.tif'
    >>> psf_path = '/path/to/psf_3D.tif'
    >>> result = decon(image_path, psf_path)


For finer-tuned control, you may wish to make an OTF file from your PSF using :func:`pycudadecon.make_otf`, and then use the :class:`pycudadecon.RLContext` context manager to setup the GPU for use with the :func:`pycudadecon.rl_decon` function.  (Note all images processed in the same context must have the same input shape).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pycudadecon import RLContext, rl_decon
    >>> from glob import glob
    >>> import tifffile
    >>> image_folder = '/path/to/some_images/'
    >>> imlist = glob(image_folder + '*488*.tif')
    >>> otf_path = '/path/to/pregenerated_otf.tif'
    >>> with tifffile.TiffFile(imlist[0]) as tf:
    >>>     imshape = tf.series[0].shape
    >>> with RLContext(imshape, otf_path, dz) as ctx:
    ...     for impath in imlist:
    ...         image = tifffile.imread(impath)
    ...         result = rl_decon(image, output_shape=ctx.out_shape)
    ...         # do something with result...

If you have a 3D PSF volume, the :class:`pycudadecon.TemporaryOTF` context manager facilitates temporary OTF generation...

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # continuing with the variables from the previous example...
    >>> psf_path = "/path/to/psf_3D.tif"
    >>> with TemporaryOTF(psf) as otf:
    ...     with RLContext(imshape, otf.path, dz) as ctx:
    ...         for impath in imlist:
    ...             image = tifffile.imread(impath)
    ...             result = rl_decon(image, output_shape=ctx.out_shape)
    ...             # do something with result...

... and that bit of code is essentially what the :func:`pycudadecon.decon` function is doing, with a little bit of additional conveniences added in.

*Each of these functions has many options and accepts multiple keyword arguments. For further information, see the documentation for the respective functions.*
